# G4SimpleApplication

## ‚≠ê About this project
This project is very simple example to approach Geant4.

#### Geometry
The main geometry including a World volume that has $100\times100\times100 cm^3$ of dimensions. The World volume was filled Air material.

#### Physics
The interface is defined in G4VModularPhysicsList. This interface is derived from the G4VUserPhysicsList interface.

I used RegisterPhysics() method to add G4EmStandardPhysics_option3 constructor. This physic constructor is recommended for medical physic application. 

#### Primary Generator
A point source placed at center of World volume. The source emitted gamma rays isotropic has 1.0 MeV.

The G4ParticleGun() method was used to define source.

#### Scoring
No quantities were recorded.

## üîß Requirements
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Geant4.10.07

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to run
- Create a new folder to build example. For example, I created "bld" folder.
    ```c++
    mkdir bld
    cd bld
    ```
- Build
    ```c++
    cmake ..
    make -j4
    ```
- Run example in interactive mode
    ```c++
    ./SimApp
    ```
